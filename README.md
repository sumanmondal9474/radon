Project - Books Management
Key points
Create a group database groupXDatabase. You can clean the db you previously used and resue that.
This time each group should have a single git branch. Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention project/booksManagementGroupX
Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed.
